## Survey Monkey Results ##
We had 14 people respond to the survey. Results from the survey we conduced are listed after each question. The number is the average ranking of importance of the question, with 1 being the most important and 5 being the least important. Comments listed in the survey included concerns that we do not currently have data sources to answer some questions and that we haven't heard from the literature committee that any of these questions have been addressed in the literature. The questions which came out as most important in the survey are in bold.

## Questions ##

**What is the empirical scaling of the energy use as a function of University size and other factors? (Data available, but question needs refinement [factors?](other.md)) (Ranking: 1.07)**

What factors determine the rate, efficiency, sources, and allocations of energy used by college and university campuses? (Data available, again "factors" needs to be defined) (Ranking: 2.57)

How do differing educational focuses scale with energy consumption across US institutions? Does the highest degree offered correlate to energy use efficiency? (Data collection in progress) (Ranking: 3.31)

Does graduation rate relate to energy consumption? (Data collection in progress) If so is there an increase with "green" energy use? ("Green" must be defined, but gross energy consumption, emissions, CO2 sequestration and a few other variables are available) (Ranking: 3.38)

Hypothesis for research institutions: 'bigger'(how quantify?) university co-linear with more research funding leads to more money available to spend on control, leads to more energy throughput. (Data unavailable) (Rephrased on survey as "How does energy use scale with research funding amount?" Ranking: 2.92)

Where do we draw system boundaries? (Question of project design) Can we recognize cryptic energy costs? (Unlikely with current data) (Ranking: 4.23)

How does energy use vary by athletic division? (Some data available, would require further collection) (Ranking: 3.92)

What do universities that are in/efficient for their size do differently? (Data available, but we would have to define efficiency) (Ranking: 2.07)

How can our study help improve energy efficiency? (Question of design important for Literature and Writing committees) (Ranking: 2.29)

**How does the size (population, economy, energy expenditure) of the institution _relative_ to the size of its surrounding "city" scale? (Data available) Should we expect to see two different modes of growth for institutions of equal size in two different contexts? (i.e. Oberlin vs. NYU)(May not have enough temporal data to compare growth) (Ranking: 1.54)**

**How does the geographic location and/or climate scale with energy use? Is it a defining variable as found in nature, or does anthroprogenic adaptation allow college communities to break known macroecological patterns? (Data available for geographic location, climate maxs, mins and means, plus the relative sizes of campuses, student bodies and surrounding population density) (Ranking: 1.43)**

How does the age of the institution effect the efficiency of energy use? (Ranking: 3.23)

Does the rank in sustainability and/or research rank provide insight towards (in)efficiency of energy use? Could these serve as proxies for innovative capacity and thus more efficient use of energy at a given institution? (Ranking: 2.46)

Additional question suggested on the survey:

How does energy use change within colleges over time?
