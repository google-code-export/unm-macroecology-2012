#add relevant points from geography and energy use papers that should be cited in our paper (in outline form)

In case we decide to use some of Felisa's ideas. Maps from reputable sources. - Mary http://voices.washingtonpost.com/ezra-klein/2010/04/the_red_state_ripoff.html

The map located in this document might help if we are looking to place universities used in our analyses within a rural or urban setting using a map. Also, see page 39 for higher education access measures-not sure if it's relevant but I'm also not sure what direction you'll go in for this question. (Linda M. Ghelfi and Timothy S. Parker A County-Level Measure of Urban Influence)- Mary

A study of Japanese energy use in the service industry found that energy is used more efficiently in densely populated areas. Partly this is due to more efficient floor plans in commercial industries. Paper also argues for deregulation of 'urban agglomeration' as it would ultimately decrease energy use/carbon footprint (which Japan is highly concerned with (Masayuki 2012 Population Density and Efficiency in Energy Consumption: An empirical analysis of service establishments).

We did not see this in our analyses, but the possible effect of urban heat islands should be mentioned as a reason for examining energy use/emissions in rural vs. urban settings. (Urban climates and heat islands: albedo, evapotranspiration, and anthropogenic heat.
Haider Taha 1997)- Mary

Difference in heat between urban and surrounding rural area can be up to 10 degrees difference. Heat islands should have an effect on energy used for thermoregulating buildings. City center has increases of temp up to 10-15\*C. In suburban areas – only 2-6\*C. Cooling degree hours is almost 2x as high in city centers than in city fringes. Interestingly, in winter, heating degree hours are quite a bit less in city centers than the city fringes (Santamouris et al 2001 ON THE IMPACT OF URBAN CLIMATE ON THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION OF BUILDINGS).

I also saw papers mentioned on the NASA site about studies that have found a significant increase in precipitation in areas surrounding cities due to this heat island effect. (Will get citations and full text if I can)- Mary



The global contribution from buildings towards energy consumption, both residential and commercial, has steadily increased reaching ﬁgures between 20% and 40% in developed countries, and has
exceeded the other major sectors: industrial and transportation.
(Pe´rez-Lombard et al. 2007 A review on buildings energy consumption information)

Buildings account for much of the energy used in cities (over half in Europe, 41% in European Union and 34% in the U.S.) The more dense the city, the less energy that should be used (primarily due to energy of transporting goods). There's an argument that increasing city densities should decrease per capita energy use - also increasing mixed use areas in cities could decrease overall energy use (Steemers 2003 Energy and city: density, buildings and transport)

we face many problems during the urbanization. These problems include cities supply, crime, traffic congestion and incident plague. (Bettencourt et al 2007 Growth, innovation, scaling, and the pace of life in cities)

People in largerc ities are much less likely to contact officials, attend community or organizational meetings, or vote in local elections.(Olive 2000 CityS izea ndC ivicI nvolvemeinnt Metropolitan America)

‘optimal city size’ is a real issue but ‘efficient size’, which depends on the functional characteristics of the city and on the spatial organisation within the urban system (Capello and Camagni 1999 Beyond Optimal City Size An Evaluation of alternative urban growth pattern)

Space per capita decreases due to higher densities as cities grow -> results in economy of scale where an increase in population (doubling) only requires ~85% increase in infrastructure (Bettencourt & West 2010 A unified theory of urban living).

Carbon footprints for larger cities are more ‘green’ per capita than smaller cities (more efficient energy use in larger cities; Bettencourt & West 2010 A unified theory of urban living)

The behavior of universities is considered from an economic perspective. It is assumed that both the administration and the faculty pursue goals consistent with their own self-interests.(Garvin, David A 1980 The Economics of University Behavior, I can't find the full text)
