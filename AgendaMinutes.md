  1. Group Organization
    * The group decided on a final list of committees and their members. These are posted as a wiki page.
  1. Question Brainstorming
    * What factors determine the rate, efficiency, sources, and allocations of energy used by college and university campuses?
    * How do differing educational focuses scale with energy consumption across US institutions?
    * Does graduation rate relate to energy consumption? If so is there an increase with "green" energy use?
    * Hypothesis for research institutions: 'bigger'(how quantify?) university co-linear with more research funding leads to more money available to spend on control, leads to more energy throughput.
    * Where do we draw system boundaries? Can we recognize cryptic energy costs?
    * How does energy use vary by athletic division?
    * What do universities that are in/efficient for their size do differently? How can our study help improve energy efficiency?
    * Level of research institution?
    * Minority serving?
    * Socio-economic status? Broader demographics of student body in general, such as traditional vs. non-traditional students.
    * Educational Tier. Look at Princeton rankings of universities? Amount of research funding, endowments?
    * Private vs. Public, liberal arts.
    * Located in metropolitan area? Ratio of student population to population of surrounding area?
    * Climate data, latitudinal gradients, coastal/on body of water?
    * Density of students per area

  1. Update from data committee
  1. Update from literature committee if one prepared
  1. Group organization continued - all groups should communicate this week and nominate a point person

# 7 Feb #
  1. Update from Data Committee
    * Current status: data from ACUPCC.org, voluntary sign up by universities. Taking CO2 equivalence (energy used on campus & transportation) and energy generated on campus vs purchased. Also gross building size, total student population. Spreadsheet on download section. Contains 1500 records for 600 universities for several years. Mostly smaller universities. Bias mitigation: make sure info is correct by contacting universities. Data comes from universities. Is list of universities on this website representative of US universities? Still in progress - compile metrics to compare list to universities in the US - private vs public, number of students, climate variables. Currently have a list of all colleges in US by name, state, number of students. ACUPCC list has a range of sizes and research focuses. Want to compare distributions.
    * Having whole class collect data? Having a hard time collecting data from universities directly. Wanted to subsample from largest university in each state regardless of ACUPCC membership because many aren't on this list - it's biased toward smaller schools with sustainability programs. Why ask for data in meters cubed when list has data in square feet? Better data than is on the list may be available, or maybe "better" data? What are concerns about using this data? Only get carbon-based energy consumption, not sure we can do anything about that. Many schools report usage by fuel sources: purchased electricity, produced on campus using gas or other. We can use spreadsheets from individual universities to check info in scrubbed data. We could use this to check outliers. We need to look at what data we have to know what data we want. We might want other stats from these schools. Lining up units between downloaded data and what we ask colleges for. Have we considered trying to get budget data for the overall university? Many schools report budget for energy (or for school?) We also have tuition costs for many schools. Figure out what data we have before we data check. Universities may not volunteer info they haven't placed online already.
      * Is using data from only one source a problem? Self-reported not collected by a single source, but not audited or peer-reviewed. Any data will be self-reported. Analysis committee needs to check biases before we move on. What can we do about biases? Depends on what they are. Won't be able to gather much more data.
  1. Update from Literature Committee
    * Just had first meeting last week. We're looking through Human Macroecology folder. Created a wiki page to summarize those papers and will evolve as we spread our reach. Put together a bibliography to funnel to writing committee et al. Try to categorize w/in bibliography.
    * Thesis found earlier, and there's a journal called _International Journal for Sustainability in Higher Education_.


# 14 Feb #
  1. Literature Committee - Update?
    * Bryan's notes
  1. Data Committee - Update on data we currently have (this is mostly for Jim and Felisa's benefit)
    * Now have geographic data for Universities - zip code, lat long, airport, automated weather data. Also have elevation.
    * Also have demographic data for cities - need to scrape from website.
  1. Analysis Committee - Update on checking for biases in data. Where do we stand?
    * Use all colleges for 2005-current - long tail before.
    * Good sampling for a variety of enrollment sizes and endowment sizes.
    * States with largest populations and most universities are best represented in the data.
    * Need data on type of school (eg. ag, research, public, private, grad program, sports team, etc).
    * We have building square footage but would like total area of campus. Might effect w/in campus commuting.
    * ln/ln plot of enrollment vs emissions. A few outliers. Slope is sublinear, ~0.8. [r2](https://code.google.com/p/unm-macroecology-2012/source/detail?r=2) is 0.52.
    * Way to standardize - population of state vs. enrollment in school.
    * Will double check outliers to make sure that the data for them makes sense or might exclude from analysis (e.g., endowment size of $100)

# 21 Feb #
  1. Literature Committee Update
    * Grappling with our role going forward.
    * Want to interface with other committees to form questions.
    * Data on energy use for universities in literature is done for individual universities. Most studies are in Europe. Focus on making individual universities sustainable.
    * Need to add general macroecology papers.
    * Question list - what are priorities? Are universities like small cities?
  1. Data Committee Update
    * Meghan (analysis) has looked at numbers of different types of schools. She also looked at campus setting (need to define terms), student/faculty ratio, and school population. Need one nice big compiled data sheet.
    * Added more categorical data.
    * need to split bachelors/associates/masters
    * Checking master data sheet for potential errors.
    * Start wiki page for description of data we have. Include what goes into each data.
    * if only tasks above needed, could be done in 1-2 weeks.
  1. Google Calendar for Project
    * Created google calendar for group.

# 20 March #
  1. Survey Monkey Results
    * Results listed on the questions page
    * What do we do with questions we didn't pick but we have data for? Put them in discussion. Some might come out within big three questions we picked.
  1. Literature Committee update?
    * We haven't summarized papers on our big questions yet. They're mostly on city scaling and haven't been addressed in the academic literature. We can do that this week. Make an issue.
  1. Google calendar link - go to your google calendar and it should come up.
  1. Next actions
    * Research Day Poster. Abstract based on work the analysis committee has already done. Need to design poster and have figures. Ask the point person from each committee to work on the poster? We need figures and writers.
    * There is a page on the wiki for analyses that have been done. It says "Analysis". There is also a page with the R code.
    * Figures and writing committee need to meet this week.
    * What do we want to do on Thursday? Have committee meetings. Writing and figures committees can meet.

# 5 April #
  1. Deadlines!
    * Work Day April 12th
    * Presentation April 17th
    * Paper due April 27th
  1. Poster done. What data analyses, figures do we want to add to the paper? What still needs to be done on analyses and figures?
    * Everyone look at poster closely to see if they have additional questions, analyses, figures before writing committee starts writing. Start a wiki page for these suggestions (Fred will do.) Everyone post comments there.
    * Feedback from poster presentation: include lat and long, age of school (probably ignore), switch building size to meters (done). Fixed rankings (done).
    * When you include commuting, how well a school does is dependent on surrounding city. EG UCLA vs San Fransisco.
    * Non-significant data is also interesting.
    * Socio-economic factors: red vs. blue states, poverty level. Do this based on residuals?
    * Bias in reporting emissions? We already compared between different categories in our data and found no biases.
    * For the ones where we have long time series, do they get better? Those schools tended to be all over, but didn't look per capita.
    * Look for peak in the middle or variance effect.
    * How was commuting put in? Don't count energy student uses in their home.
    * Linear relationship with area, sublinear relationship with number of students, so economy of scale with number of students. How does scaling per student work? Suggests you add more students faster than you add more square footage. Try plotting.
  1. Writing update. Can we expand poster into paper, or do we need to reorganize?
    * Need literature committee to give us direction on the introduction.  They are meeting tomorrow.
    * For poster, wrote a lot of text in long form on wiki that could be a good place to start.
