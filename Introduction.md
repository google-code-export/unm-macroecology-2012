# Project Home #

There are some good tools here:
### Updates ###
This shows a list of all activity by time.  It's a good way to see what's happened recently.
### Project Feeds ###
You can add the **Project Updates** feed to your Google Reader (or other news reader) to get updates.
If anyone tries this and finds it interesting, you should let us know.


# Downloads #
Pretty self-explanatory.  Just remember -- only upload things that are legal (e.g. public domain, or you own copywrite).

# Wiki #

Feel free to create new pages and edit existing pages.  If you want, you can add your name or initials to comments.  Please be courteous about modifying other people's work.
When you edit a page, any changes are tracked by the system, so nothing is ever really erased.

See the "Wiki markup help" link (upper right) for advice about formatting pages.

Remember that everything posted here is public -- please do not post copywrited materials.

# Issues #
I propose we use this as a to-do list.  This allows us to see everything that's been done and needs to be done.
### How to make a new issue ###
  * Click new issue, add a short, descriptive title, and a description of the task.
  * Set the status to **New**
  * Please add the relevant committee name to the labels
  * Set an appropriate priority label if you want.
### How to use existing issues ###
  * Anyone can add their username to the CC box of an issue to follow it.
  * Feel free to add comments to issues.
  * Once an issue is completed, please change the status to **Done**.
  * Notice - you can search for issues that you own, follow, etc.
