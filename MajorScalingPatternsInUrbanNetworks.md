Urban centers make economies of scale possible.  However, universities themselves function as small cities in many ways, and it is thus instructive to investigate whether scaling relationships observed for cities also hold for universities.  The goal of this page is to provide a list of such relationships most applicable to our project.

# Introduction #

Format as follows:
  * item
    * citation
    * significance and/or applicability to project

# Materials/Infrastructure #
  * Total electrical consumption (first and foremost; Bettencourt et al. 2007)
  * Total housing (Bettencourt et al. 2007)
  * Total employment (Bettencourt et al. 2007)
  * Total square footage of buildings, total acreage
  * Energy conversion efficiency based on source/type

# Environmental Variables #
  * Lat/Long (In Progress by Data team based on zip)
  * Temperature [mean,min,max] (http://www.city-data.com/city/, data from nearest airport weather station)
  * Humidity [mean,min,max] (http://www.city-data.com/city/, data from nearest airport weather station)

# Social Variables #
  * Measures of 'supercreativity' (for our study, this could take the form of numbers of faculty and students teaching and enrolled, respectively, in supercreative programs of study). This is possibly analogous to measures of 'educational focus' as stated on the 'Questions' wiki. (Bettencourt et al. 2007)
  * Crimes (Bettencourt et al. 2007, Bettencourt and West 2010)
  * New patents, number of patentholders (Bettencourt et al. 2007, Bettencourt and West 2010)

Bettencourt and West 2010
The crime rate, GDP, income and patents increase dramatically, when the city population increases.

Coal
In 1864, the annual production of coal in the world reached 180 million tons per year until 1914. The production reached a rate of 1300 million tons per year. It continued to increase geometrically at the rate of 4% annually. By the end of 1947, the cumulative production of coals in human history was 81 billion tons. Of this, 40 billion has been mined and consumed since 1920. Sixty-two billion has been produced since 1900.
Petroleum
The world production of petroleum was doubled from 1860 to 1929. Since 1929, the doubling period increased to about 15 years. The cumulative production by the end of 1947 was 9.17 billion cubic meters. Of this, one-half has been produced and consumed since 1937 and 97% since 1900.
Growth of population
> The world population has increased from about 545 million in 1650 to 2171 million by 1940. The greatest rate of increase during the period was that of the last half century.
