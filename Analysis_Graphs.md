This page is to write down and post what analyses we've done so far:

1) Population (full + part-time students, staff, and faculty) v. Gross Emissions (Scope 1 + 2)

2) Population v. Net Emissions

3) Area (building area) v. Gross Emissions

4) Density (Population/Area) v. Gross Emissions

5) Income (Endowment) v. Gross Emissions
