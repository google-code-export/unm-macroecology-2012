### Hubbert, M.K. 1949. Energy from fossil fuels. Science 109:103-109. ###
_Energy from fossil fuels_
> I think this is a good paper for writing committee to cite in their introduction. In this paper, Hubbert reviewed different types of energy had been utilized during human history. He described how we discovered three basic fossil materials – coal, petroleum and natural gas, and oil shale. Hubbert also compared the production of three types of fuels after the year of 1800. The author analyzed the growth of population, when we entered the Industrial Age. Hubbert evaluated the total amounts of fossil fuels that we could potentially use. Considering the global industrialization and the growth of population, the author thought exhaustion of the mineral fuels would accelerate in future and he also gave the time perspective on fossil fuels. In the end, he mentioned that water power might be an alternative choice for fossil fuels.

Additional notes:
  * Rate of fossil fuel utilization steadily increased until mid 1800s, then exponential until 1950 (time of paper). Human population boom coincident with fossil fuel utilization.
  * Both human population expansion and current fossil fuel use unsustainable.
  * Estimated how much coal, petroleum may be present on earth through known geological formations. Also how much has been used thus far and how much would be expected to be used in future.

### Smil, V. 2008. Moore's Curse and the Great Energy Delusion. The American November, 19 2008, 6 pgs. ###
_Moore’s Curse and the Great Energy Delusion_
  * This piece is essentially a reactionary article to the arguments that we can and must make a quick transition from fossil fuel energy to alternative energies, particularly Gore’s 10 and 30 year plans to switch to wind and solar energy. Smil cites that Moore’s Law, a reference to the exponential growth of computer technology, only applies to systems that do not require large underlying infrastructures. He points out that each energy transition, wood to coal, coal to oil, etc, takes decades not just a few years. Furthermore, these transitions take increasingly longer as the system that is being supplied with energy becomes bigger requiring more energy, money and raw materials for supportive structures.  Due to this we can’t expect that we can make these hypothesized energy transitions in the times that have been set, if it is even possible for us to do so at this point.

  * This is an article in a popular magazine, not a scientific investigation. However, the arguments are sound, and this gives our group a good reason to investigate energy use patterns. While it is unlikely that we will find a fix all, we may be able to suggest new systems to speed the transition based on economically successful energy uses found within our study.

_Energetic limits to economic growth_
There is a positive sublinear relationship between per capita GDP and per capita energy use. This relationship scales with a log linear slope of 0.76. This is close to three quarters, which is the theoretical value for the scaling of metabolic rate with with body mass. The implication is that both animals and economies have metabolisms.
  * Energy limits economic activity
  * Higher rates of energy consumption are required to establish economies with greater levels of technological development and standards of living.
  * Nearly all measures of standard of living are correlated with GDP (Figure 3 in paper).
  * Raises the question of whether increased human population, technological development, and standard of living can continue on their current trajectories. Not enough energy available to bring all countries up to China's standards (268 terawatts, or 16 times the worlds current energy use)
  * Additional economic growth and development will require increased energy supply, decreased per capita energy use, and decreased human population.
  * The sublinearity of the GDP/energy use scaling relationship is due to the ability of persons in large economies to "take advantage of economies of scale (p.20)".  Essentially, using more energy but in an increasingly efficient manner.  While the paper doesn't explicitly take future increases in efficiency into account, these will inevitably occur, changing the scaling dynamics of the relationship but likely not affecting the rigidity of underlying energetic constraints.


- Melissa  -Bryan

I would just add that Iceland, Norway, and Sweden were found to have among the highest rates of per capita energy use. The authors hypothesized that this result was due to the amount of energy needed to heat homes and workplaces during the cold winters in these high-latitude countries. We could refer to this in our paper as a reason to predict that Universities at higher latitudes use more energy.

### Tverberg GE 2011 ###
_Oil supply limits and the continuing financial crisis, Energy_

  * Tverberg presents the patterns of economic decline, and possible collapse, in response to oil demand and price fluctuations. All but one large scale financial depression in the past century has been preceded by a large fluctuation in the oil market, of which almost all industrialized countries are dependent on for production and transport of goods and services. This direct correlation has been seen with each depression as oil supply has been restricted, which creates a negative feedback loop within the economy. Conversely as oil supply is increased, or supplied to the market at lower prices after the demand has dropped, a positive feedback loop occurs building off increased production, increased spending and increased security when borrowing.

  * Oil supply has maintained a steady state for years, and this is most likely not going to change. However, developed countries are attempting to reduce to oil demand, while currently developing countries are increasing their demand. This creates an imbalance in the developed economies as the oil prices do not drop with decreased demand, and costs of production continue to rise while profits remain low. This is what is currently creating negative feedback loops, and with developing countries demanding more oil while the supply is stable, it is likely that economic situations in developed industry leading countries will continue to decline.

  * This paper, like the earlier article, provides us with a convincing argument for proceeding with this research, and support from public interest as money is a prime motivator. I will most likely add to this following the PIBBs presentation.

### Cleveland et. al. 1984 ###
_Energy and the U.S. Economy_


> The authors of this paper strive to underline the importance of energy input (fuel use) as the basis for economic activity. Energy is needed for all goods and services created, but the economic models of the time did not take this aspect under proper consideration. For example, fuel input is needed to create capital and labor, but this is not normally taken into account in economic models. The authors emphasize that there is a physical interdependence between energy input an all other factors affecting the production of goods and services.

> Specifically, this study examined the links between fuel use, GNP (Gross National Product – anything that is American owned – not limited by geographic location (GDP is)). They found that fuel use over the last 90 years is strongly correlated with GNP (r<sup>2</sup>=0.98). This relationship also holds up under a cross-sectional analysis of the U.S. economy.

> The authors also found evidence that inflation is related to high fuel prices, when the money supply is greater than available fuel. Oil production in the U.S. peaked in 1973, and the costs of extracting or obtaining are rising. If economic growth is to continue, the authors argue that new fuel technologies will need to be developed that rival oil in its energy efficiency. When this paper was published, the author did not find prospects for alternative energy sources promising.

> This paper is an important step in biologists’ contribution to economic theory, and contributes to what has more recently been touted as a thermodynamic approach to economics. In terms of the theoretical basis and predictions for our project, it would be interesting to consider how the size of universities (#of students, size, perhaps budget??) could be analogous to their ‘GDP’, and thus, the basis for their energy use.

> It is also a good background paper for considering how effective alternative forms of energy (if they are employed by universities) are – and how their effectiveness has changed since 1984, when this paper was published.

### Hall 2004 ###
_The Myth of Sustainable Development_
> This article is written from the personal history perspective of the author, tracing his experiences over the last several decades with energy and the oil industry. He writes about the ‘energy crisis’ in the early 1970’s, and the book published by the ‘Club of Rome’ warning that once we hit the limit on growth, our economies will crash, which will in turn lead to a global population crash. They were largely ignored, even by most scientists. The author, however, argues that the model’s predictions are so far right on target.

> Neoclassical economics, or neoliberalism, is based on a strategy of constant growth. Once the 1973 oil crisis resolved, it appeared to be a success for neoliberalism. Neoliberals argue that when oil prices rise, there is increased incentive to develop substitute resources, as well as more efficient ways of using the supply we have. However, efficiency has a sloppy definition, and often efficiency leads to increased use. Electric utilities substituted coal for oil. Ultimately, neither efficiency nor substitution fixes the problem of finite resources.

> The author then discusses the term ‘sustainability’, which has several definitions: sustainability of social structures (i.e. communities or lifestyles), economic sustainability, and ecological, or resource, sustainability, which ensures the resource base for future economic activity. Paradoxically, meeting one goal often comes at the expense of another.

> Finally, the author discusses two examples to answer the question: are we more sustainable today? The first example was the U.S., considered the champion of neoclassical economics. Today, we produce only half the oil we did in 1970, and our country has gone into debt in order to import the needed oil. Costa Rica, the sustainability poster child of Central America, fared no better in the author’s analysis. The country imports 1/3 of its food, along with vast amounts of agrochemicals and fuel. In addition, 80% of its forests have been cut down. These examples illustrate that our current infrastructure is very unlikely to approach anything resembling sustainability, and the author suggests that we stop using the term completely until we find a substitute for cheap oil, make the transition, and learn to live on much less energy.

### Owen, David 2010 ###
_The Efficiency Dilemma_

This article explores the meaning of energy efficiency gains in terms of overall consumption. The question it attempts to answer is if increased efficiency leads to increased consumption. This idea was espoused by William Stanley Jevons in 1865 towards the end of the industrial revolution when the industrial world was growing rapidly (it still is in parts of the world). “When we talk about increasing energy efficiency, what we’re really talking about is increasing the productivity of energy” …. You have the effect of reducing its implicit price, because you get more return for the same money – which means the demand goes up. Increased consumption more than cancels out any energy savings.” The idea appears to be impossible to prove or disprove, but the article outlines many examples of the phenomenon such as:

1)	Increases in the efficiency of refrigeration leading to more refrigeration devices in an average home or business (think gas station and hotel room); changes in the food supply industry including the transport of food over long distances and decreases in price; more food waste by the average consumer because food is cheaper and the means to store this cheap food is available, but the ability to consume the food before it expires has not gone up. Americans now throw away about 40% of all the edible food we produce. How much energy gets tossed in a landfill under these circumstances?

2)	Air-conditioning is now affordable to most consumers partly due to efficiency gains. This led to an increase in overall energy consumption for air conditioning.

3)	“Between 1984 and 2005, American electricity production grew by about 66% - and it did so despite economy-wide gains in energy efficiency. The increase was partly the result of population growth; but per-capita energy consumption rose, too, and it did so even though energy use per dollar of GDP fell by roughly half.”

4)	“Population growth itself can be a Jevons effect: the more efficient we become, the more people we can sustain; the more people we sustain, the more energy we consume.

The flip-side:

Many experts in energy policy, economists, and efficiency experts agree that the Jevons effect does happen today but does not negate efficiency gains and their benefits except in certain sectors of the economy such as air travel and some metals and chemicals production.

_The Impending Peak and Decline of Petroleum Production: an Underestimated Challenge for Conservation of Ecological Integrity_

This paper is addressing the need to include resource constrained scenarios in global assessments of environmental change. The belief put forth by economists and adopted by many governments that technology would prevent resource constraints has prevented groups like the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change from including resource limitations in their simulations and scenarios. The reality is that peak oil will soon be reached and the consequences for western civilization are tremendous. The authors explore alternatives and the idea that development of alternatives would require a significant portion of the world’s remaining oil to produce the equipment such as wind turbines and solar panels necessary to run these alternative energy producing systems. It is very likely that energy consumption will have to be reduced and a changing pattern of resource use will emerge. “Ecologists can contribute to the debate on peak oil by providing tools to describe energy flow through complex systems and clarifying the consequences of changing energy availability.”

Non-human species, ecosystems, and nature conservation will also be greatly affected by changes in industrial activity and these effects could be advantageous or disadvantageous for them depending on the scenario. Ecologists and conservation biologists are needed to study and call attention to human actions that will cause fundamental damage to ecological systems.

“An often neglected but crucial factor in (the rise of western civilization) was the immense flow of fossil energy, which provided humans with significant competitive advantages over other organisms. ….. Humans found a tremendously profitable energy niche within the ecological system of the planet. But what will happen if this niche closes up? We argue that this will be the greatest social and environmental challenge of the 21st century.”

_A unified theory of urban living_
> In this paper, the authors review the process of urbanization and its impact on our living. They evaluate the urban population in 2050 based on the recorded urbanization speed. The paper also points the problems that we face during the urbanization. These problems include cities supply, crime, traffic congestion and incident plague. The paper lists the main characteristics of cities and how they vary systematically with population. The authors conclude that it is important to understand the cities’ dynamics, growth and evolution in order to avoid the potential disasters.

_Human Macroecology: linking pattern and process in big-picture human ecology_

This is a good starting point for theoretical considerations of the project, including how civilizations affect rates of human innovation and the abundance of 'supercreative' jobs.  The macroecological perspective offers a framework within which to examine other mechanisms as well, like human life history and patterns of cultural diversity.

II. The human foraging niche is unique:
  * extreme dietary breadth
  * high risk/high reward prey: energetic gain from large hunts offsets energetic inputs
  * high-skill foraging methods

III. Human life-histories are unique:
  * SLOW.  Slow growth and development, long time to maturity, low fecundity
  * Reproduction, growth & maintenance all determined by metabolic gain throughout life - humans in some instances can alleviate constraints on life history processes through technology & sociality
  * Human life history exceptionally low compared to similar sized mammals
  * These traits are part of a trend among primates with increasing body size
  * Cooperative foraging in social groups and extended post-reproductive lifespans fuel the trend

VII. Industrial Metabolism
  * Human metabolism is ~ 120W, comparable to similarly sized mammals. Modern humans use ~ 300W in hunter-gatherer societies & up to ~ 1100W in highly developed societies. So much more is used than needed.
  * Acquisition and use of extra-metabolic (non-biological) _missing noun_ have permitted cultural diversification and industrialization
  * This has further extended the primate trend towards low fecundity
  * With increasingly complex societies, the energy necessary to raise a 'fit' individual is far greater than the simple biological requirement
  * per capita energy use and economic growth are correlated. Energy use scales sublinearly w/ GDP - scaling exponent similar to metabolic rate/body mass.

VIII. Urban Systems
  * Use of gas & electricity scales sublinearly w/ population size in cities (indicative of economy of scale). Due to concentration of people so that energetic inputs more efficiently used.
  * Could be interesting to test if more 'compact' universities use less energy per student than larger more spread out campuses.
  * larger and more concentrated human populations (i.e., cities) fuel innovation and resource extraction and use.
  * however, large cities have a smaller per capita ecological footprint (economy of scale)
  * The number of individuals in 'supercreative' jobs scales superlinearly with population size
  * Cities as social 'accelerators'

### Bettencourt et al. 2007 ###
_Growth, innovation, scaling, and the pace of life in cities_

I think an important (for us) theme of the paper is that cities can be viewed as extensions of, and display some of the same scaling relations as, biological systems.  One useful line of investigation for our project would then be to examine the extent to which universities also display these scaling properties, i.e. behave themselves as small 'cities'.
  * One important result of urbanization is the increased division of labor and rate of innovation and/or wealth creation.  Cities are major engines of innovation and economic growth.  However, across both space and time cities are found to be scaled versions of one another with regards to population size and characteristic properties.
  * There are three general behaviors of urban indicators uncovered by this study:

> --**material** quantities display economies of scale (sublinear / beta < 1; these are characteristic of infrastructure networks)
> --**social currencies** display increasing returns with pop. size (superlinear / beta > 1; these are found to be many and are socially-driven (i.e., they have limited biological equivalents))
> --**maintenance** variables display beta = 1

  * Social currencies (beta > 1) fuel greater-than-exponential population growth and drive innovation at increasingly short time scales.  However, finite resources still place limits on this growth.  Avoidance of collapse in such a society (i.e., one driven by wealth and knowledge creation) requires that rates of innovation also increase superlinearly over time, where innovation essentially constitutes a reset of initial growth parameters.
