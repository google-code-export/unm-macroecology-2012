-Thermoregulation is essential in endothermic creatures for maintaining energetic balance.  Beyond a relatively small range of external temperatures which bracket optimal body temperature, the energetic requirements for maintaining thermal homeostasis increase significantly.

(Cossins and Bowler 1987)

-It has been shown that the relationship of metabolic rate with surrounding temperature holds not only for individual endotherms, but also for human households.  Meehan (in press) demonstrated that average monthly energy consumption of American households at external temperatures ranging from 0-25 degrees Celcius conformed to the relationship predicted for endotherms across this same temperature range.

There has been little research published in scientific journals on the topic of variation in energy consumption in the United States. The most detailed information available is from the Energy Information Administration (EIA).

One study conducted in the U.S. on the eight most energy-intensive states found a strong relationship between heating degree days and electricity consumption. They found that looking at temperature alone was problematic because different models are needed for the summer and winter months.

(Sailor and Mu√±oz 1997)

Another study conducted in Greece concluded that heating degree days are an excellent way to assess energy demand on a regional scale, predicting that heating costs would be 9 times greater in an area of northern Greece compared to an island in southern Greece.

(Matzarakis and Balafoutis 2004)

It should also be noted that differences in architecture that are suited for different climates (i.e. preventing heat loss or heat gain) can affect energy consumption. For example, solar film coating on windows can reduce solar heat gain in office buildings by 30-40%. This could help explain differences in energy consumption for university buildings in similar climates.

(Yang et. al. 2008)

-However, our data indicate that energy use scales most closely with university building area, with regional temperature only slightly improving the linear model.  This is curious because heating and cooling costs are likely substantial at universities, and these are necessary expenditures: the Occupational Health and Safety Administration (OSHA) recommends temperature control in the range of 68-76F, and it is well known that thermally regulated environments are essential for cognitive performance.

(Hancock and Vazmatzidis 2003, Staal 2004, http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=INTERPRETATIONS&p_id=24602)

-Perhaps this is because **cumulative** annual heating and cooling costs are similar across climate zones.  However, this is unlikely because heating requires significantly greater energy use than cooling, and universities in colder zones should use relatively more energy than ones in warm zones.  So whats the deal??

-This paper focuses on the mechanisms that lead to known species abundance patterns, and their corresponding ranges.

  * Sampling: observable patterns could be due to under or overestimation
  * Phylogeny: (not particularly relevant for this study)
  * Range: lower abundances at the edge of ranges
  * Resource breadth: higher abundances of generalists
  * Resource availability: Higher local abundances near high levels of resources
  * Density dependence, population growth rate and population structure

-Authors concluded that no one factor can be ascribed to observable patterns. This may be good support for why many of our geographic/climate factors only contribute for a very small percentage of the variation in the data.

(Gaston, Blackburn and Lawton, 1997)

-This is a good representation of the energy equivalence rule used as a baseline from which variation in species abundance (success) can be measured. Authors show that the EER accounts for majority of scaling for clades, and can be used to understand how resource abundance/size and the partitioning of resources affects species abundance.

(Carbone et al, 2007)

-Authors looking at global species diversity find that, as previous research has found, energy and water account for the highest percentage of spacial variation of density. This follows a latitudinal gradient, but in the higher latitudes energy levels are a better predictor of density, and in lower latitudes water variables are better predictors.
