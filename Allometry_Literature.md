#Add important points from Allometry papers that should be cited (in outline form)

There is a surprising lack of literature on the subject of allometric scaling of colleges and universities with regards to energy use.
  * An allometric approach has not been utilized as a means to evaluating the sustainability of energy use of academic institutions.
    * This may be a desirable strategy to use when evaluating energy efficiency, because scaling relationships describe generic features.

The current strategy for determining green-ness is currently bogged down by idiosyncrasies of individual institutions.

Most attempts at sustainability have occurred at the individual university level, with specific targets set that are highly dependent on the unique situation of a particular university (for examples see Button 2008; Riddell, Bhatia, Parisi, Foote, and Imperatore III 2008;  Rauch and Newman 2007, 2009; Thurston and Eckelman 2010)

An allometric approach would demonstrate the expected energy use of an academic institution based on size and other factors.
  * These relationships have been described for countries and cities (Isalgue, Coch, and Serra 2007; Zhang and Yu 2010; Bettencourt and West 2010).
  * "Even though cities seem quite far from living organisms, some general activities take place in both of them: among these activities one finds transforming energy, transporting and transmitting energy, information and goods, and repairing damage to some amount. Furthermore, if biological scaling laws are the consequence of the above constraints, modern, developed cities are also subject to some of these kinds of network-related constraints" (Isalgue, Coch, and Serra 2007)

  * "A rough estimation shows that modern cities approach some of the scaling behaviour followed by living organisms. This might be interpreted as due to that both systems are essentially transport conditioned, and optimisation of systems is under way" (Isalgue, Coch, and Serra 2007)

  * Looked at scaling of countries: area, population, and GDP (Zhang and Yu 2010).
    * Most economic, trade, energy consumption have super-linear or linear scaling relationships (Zhang and Yu 2010).
    * Geographic, demographic, transportation properties have sub-linear relationships with area (Zhang and Yu 2010).
    * Power law relations different between cities and countries: population is sub-linear with area in countries, GDP increases linearly in countries but super-linearly in cities. Energy consumption increases with population faster in countries than cities (Zhang and Yu 2010).
  * "size is the major determinant of most characteristics of a city" (Betancourt and West 2010)

Determining energetic scaling relationships would also reveal which academic institutions are succeeding at being "green", and potentially reveal attributes of institutions that are failing.
